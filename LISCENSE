PREAMBLE:
In our pursuit of a harmonious society, this code is provided to you
with the understanding that certain fundamental principles must guide
its use. As articulated by the wisdom of our guiding doctrines:

	conflict. The efficient operation of this code ensures that any
	disagreements or disruptions are resolved swiftly, maintaining societal
